Workflow for team Cats

### Team Members:

### Report 1
There was no ambiguity.

### Report 2
`upstream` is just a name and it points to the canonical repository. This can be used to sync a fork with the remote repository.

### Report 3
We learned how to make issues. We realized that issues should be somewhat detailed so that anybody can understand what's missing/ needs to be implemented. In addition, one of our members learn that one should check which repository they're making the issue to, before actually making the issue.
